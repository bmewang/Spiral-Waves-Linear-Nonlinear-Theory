# Spiral-Waves-Linear-Nonlinear-Theory
Code (EZ-Spiral and Matlab) to reproduce computations in [Sandstede &amp; Scheel (2020)].

# Instructions for Use

This repository provides the [EZ-Spiral](http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~masax/Software/ez_software.html) code written by Dwight Barkley and [Matlab code written by Stephanie Dodson and Bjorn Sandstede](https://github.com/sandstede-lab/Spiral-Waves-Boundary-Sinks-and-Spectra) to solve for spiral waves and their spectra from [Sandstede and Scheel. Spiral waves: linear and nonlinear theory]. Details about the methods used can be found in [S Dodson and B Sandstede. SIADS 18 (2019) 2202-2226](http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/19M1264813) and [Sandstede &amp; Scheel (2020)].

The codes are organized separately by code and model. All direct numerical simulations are done using EZ-Spiral, and the codes are in folders starting with "dns". Continuation of spiral waves and the computation of their spectra are done using Matlab in the folders starting with "matlab".
