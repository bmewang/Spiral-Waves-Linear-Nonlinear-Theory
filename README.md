# Spiral-Waves-Linear-Nonlinear-Theory
Code (EZ-Spiral and Matlab) to reproduce computations in [Sandstede &amp; Scheel 2020].

# Instructions for Use

This repository provides [EZ-Spiral](http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~masax/Software/ez_software.html) and Matlab code
to solve for spiral waves and their spectra from [B Sandstede and A Scheel. Spiral waves: linear and nonlinear theory]
Details about the methods used can be found in the paper, here we provide instructions on how to run the codes.

In general, the codes are organized into folders separately by model and code. All direct numerical simulations are done
using EZ-Spiral, and the codes are in folders starting with "dns". Continuation of spiral waves and the computation of
their spectra are done using Matlab.
